GeoJSON_Files
=============

This is just a simple test on the 'new' mapping functionality of GitHub, described in the [help](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github) and the [blog](https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements)

These are the testfiles:

* spec_data.geojson ... contains all geometries of the [GeoJSON specification](http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html)
