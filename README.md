GeoJSON_Files
=============

This is just a simple test on the 'new' mapping functionality of GitHub, described in the [help](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github) and the [blog](https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements)

These are the testfiles:

* spec_data.geojson ... contains all geometries of the [GeoJSON specification](http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html)

* spec_data.topojson ... same data as above, but as a topojson-file
--> the corresponding command: *topojson -p -o spec_data.topojson spec_data.geojson*


*Just click them and you will see the corresponding data on a map!*
